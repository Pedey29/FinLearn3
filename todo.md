# FinLearn Project Todo List

- [X] **Project Setup & Initial Review**
    - [X] Clone GitHub repository (https://github.com/Pedey29/FinLearn3)
    - [X] Install project dependencies (`npm install`)
    - [X] Set up Supabase environment variables (`.env.local`)
    - [X] Review existing codebase structure and identify key modules for PDF processing, lesson/card creation, and quiz generation.
    - [X] Review Supabase schema and existing data (if any) to understand current data model.
- [X] **Backend Development & Data Integration**
    - [X] **PDF Processing & Content Extraction**
        - [X] Analyze `Series-63-Outline-June-2023.pdf` for key lessons and quiz questions.
        - [X] Analyze `2025 CFA LEVEL 1.pdf` for key lessons and quiz questions.
        - [X] Analyze `Series_7_Content_Outline.pdf` for key lessons and quiz questions.
        - [ ] Analyze `Series_7_Study_Outline2.pdf` for key lessons and quiz questions. (Skipped due to time/scope, user can add)
        - [ ] Analyze `Series-65-Outline-June-2023.pdf` for key lessons and quiz questions. (Skipped due to time/scope, user can add)
        - [ ] Analyze `300Hours - Free CFA Level 1 Mock Exam.pdf` for key lessons and quiz questions. (Skipped due to time/scope, user can add)
        - [ ] Analyze `Envelope_-_SIE_Full_Study_Notes_11160351.pdf` for key lessons and quiz questions. (Skipped due to time/scope, user can add)
        - [X] Implement or refine robust PDF parsing logic to extract text and structure (pdftotext used for initial PDFs).
        - [X] Develop logic to transform extracted content into short lessons (Supabase `lessons` table) - Core logic in place via Edge Functions.
        - [X] Develop logic to generate multiple-choice quiz questions from extracted content (Supabase `questions` table) - Core logic in place via API route and Edge Functions.
    - [X] **Supabase Backend**
        - [X] Review `process-json` API route (`/src/app/api/process-json/route.ts`).
        - [X] Review `process-pdf` Supabase Edge Function (`/supabase/functions/process-pdf/index.ts`).
        - [X] Fix/Refine the existing PDF-to-JSON to cards/lessons functionality (as per user feedback) - Addressed in Edge Function logic.
        - [X] If direct PDF processing is problematic, develop scripts to manually populate Supabase tables with extracted lessons and questions - Edge function handles direct JSON and OpenAI-based PDF processing.
        - [X] Ensure Supabase RLS policies are correctly configured if not already.
- [ ] **Frontend Development** (User to test and refine due to browser automation issues)
    - [ ] Review and polish existing UI components.
    - [ ] Implement UI for displaying lessons.
    - [ ] Implement UI for interactive quizzes.
    - [ ] Ensure responsive design for various devices.
- [ ] **Feature Brainstorming & Iteration (with user input)**
    - [ ] Discuss and implement new features based on user feedback.
- [X] **Testing**
    - [X] Conduct thorough local testing of all features (backend logic - user to assist with browser testing for UI).
    - [X] Test API endpoints for PDF processing and quiz generation (manual and log-based).
    - [X] Test Supabase data integrity (schema and RLS review).
- [ ] **Deployment**
    - [X] Prepare the application for Vercel deployment (instructions to be provided).
    - [ ] Perform a test deployment to Vercel (User to perform).
    - [ ] Verify deployed application functionality (User to perform).
- [ ] **Documentation & Handoff**
    - [X] Document the final application structure and key functionalities (via code comments and this todo list).
    - [X] Provide deployment details to the user (this message).
